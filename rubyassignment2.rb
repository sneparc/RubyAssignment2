# 	myString= "It has been said that the film O Brother Where Art Thou, directed by the Coen brothers, was a retelling of The Odyssey, by Homer. O Brother Where Art Thou took place in Mississippi during the 1930s, and was about three men, Everett, Pete, and Delmar, who escaped prison so they might search for a “treasure.” “They did this while a relentless lawman pursued them” (“Synopsis”). The Odyssey, was an epic poem about a man named, Odysseus, who was returning home from the Trojan War. His return journey took him to a variety of different places that caused him to struggle indefinitely. O Brother Where Art Thou counted as a retelling of the Odyssey because it had a similar plot structure to it and Everett embodied Odysseus in that he had a similar full name and epithet to Odysseus and he had Odysseus’s good fate.One way O Brother Where Art Thou had a related plot structure to The Odyssey was that they both began their plots with the implication of the muse. In the first scene of the movie, the Coen brothers placed a single quote written in white letters on a black screen that read, “ O Muse! Sing in me, and through me tell the story of that man skilled in all ways of contending, a wanderer, harried for years on end…” (O Brother Where Art Thou) This scene was related to Homer’s implication of the Muse in The Odyssey. In the first line, Homer wrote, “Sing to me of the man, Muse, the man of twists and turns driven time and again off course, once he had plundered the hallowed heights of Troy” (The Odyssey I, 1-3). The Coen brothers’ quote counted as an implication of the Muse because it followed the procedure of implicating the Muse in ancient literature, which was to name the Muse and place it at the beginning of the work. Anyone who had opened the first page of The Odyssey would be able to see that the Coens’ quote was an implication of the Muse, and it was related to The Odyssey because of the procedure it followed. Another way O Brother Where Art Thou had a similar plot structure to the Odyssey was that Everett, Pete, and Delmar escaped prison so that they might go on a journey to search for “treasure.” After Everett and his men escaped from the chain gang, there was a scene where they received a ride from an elderly blind man on a railway handcar. The elderly blind man foretold them about the journey they would be taking, and prophesized that “they will travel a long and difficult road, a road fraught with peril, you shall see fame, wonderful to tell…I cannot tell you how long this road shall be, but fear not the obstacles in your path for fate has vouchsafed you rewards…” (O Brother Where Art Thou). It was evident from this scene that Everett and his men would go on a journey that would be difficult and full of obstacles. This scene was related to The Odyssey because Odysseus’s return from Troy took him to a variety of different places and peoples, and many of the experiences Everett and his men encountered were comparable to those Odysseus encountered on his return home to Ithaca. The scene where Everett, Delmar and Pete went to visit Pete’s cousin, Wallace Hogwallop, was related to Odysseus’s visit to King Alcinous of Phaeacia in Book V and VI of The Odyssey in that they both experienced, xenia, or guest friendship, from their hosts. In ancient times, hosts would show xenia to strangers out of respect for Zeus. In the scene, Washington Hogwallop showed xenia because he removed their shackles, fed them, and allowed them to sleep in his barn. Even though one would say when Washington Hogwallop tried to turn them in to authorities for the reward it was not a show of xenia, Washington Hogwallop’s young son made up for it with a true showing of xenia. When the barn was set ablaze by the authorities, Hogwallop’s young son rescued Everett, Pete, and Delmar and helped them escape when he drove them out of the barn in a car. This scene was related to many scenes in The Odyssey where Odysseus’s hosts showed him xenia, but it was specifically related to his visit to King Alcinous of Phaeacia. When Odysseus was in Phaeacia, King Alcinous showed him xenia because he welcomed him into his palace, fed him, entertained him, gave him a bed to sleep in, and promised him a free passage home to Ithaca. As Everett, Pete, and Delmar continued on their journey, they encountered a baptism, which was related to Odysseus’s experience with the lotus-eaters in Book IX of The Odyssey. In the scene, Pete and Delmar were baptized because they believed that it would clear away their sins, while Everett resisted. This scene was related to Odysseus’s experience with the lotus-eaters because a few of his men tasted the lotus, while Odysseus did not. When Odysseus realized he sent his men into a colony of lotus-eaters, he went and rescued them. Everett’s resistance to the baptism was similar to Odysseus’s experience with the lotus-eaters because like Odysseus, he was the only one who was not baptized and urged his men to continue on with their search."

# anaylzeBlock ("A specially equipped medical plane whisked Ebola-stricken Dr. Kent Brantly from Liberia to Georgia on Saturday, setting up the latest leg of a race to save the man who's now the first known Ebola patient on U.S. soil. An ambulance rushed Brantly -- one of two Americans seriously sickened by the deadly viral hemorrhagic fever last month while on the front lines of a major outbreak in West Africa -- from Dobbins Air Reserve Base to Atlanta's Emory University Hospital shortly after the plane landed late Saturday morning. Video from Emory showed someone wearing a white, full-body protective suit helping a similarly clad person emerge from the ambulance and walk into the hospital. Emory has said it will treat Brantly, 33, and, eventually, the other American, fellow missionary Nancy Writebol, in an isolation unit. There, physicians say they have a better chance to steer them to health while ensuring the virus doesn't spread -- the last point nodding to public fears, notably expressed on social media, that the disease could get a U.S. foothold. The plane, also equipped with a unit meant to isolate the patient, was able to take only one patient at a time. Organizers expect the plane will now pick up Writebol in Liberia, and bring her to Georgia early next week, said Todd Shearer, spokesman for Christian charity Samaritan's Purse, with which both Americans were affiliated. Brantly's wife, parents and sister cried when they saw him on CNN, walking from the ambulance into the hospital, a family representative said on condition of anonymity. His wife, Amber, later said she was relieved that her husband was back in the United States. I spoke with him, and he is glad to be back in the U.S., she said in statement sent to CNN. I am thankful to God for his safe transport and for giving him the strength to walk into the hospital. Brantly's wife visited with him from behind a glass wall for about 45 minutes, the family representative said. Kent Brantly was described as being in great spirits and so grateful. Brantly, who has ties to Texas and Indiana, and Writebol, of North Carolina, became sick while caring for Ebola patients in Liberia, one of three West African nations hit by an outbreak that health officials believe has sickened more than 1,300 people and killed more than 700 this year.")

# anaylzeBlock("We investigate the fine grained object categorization problem of determining the breed of animal from an image. To this end we introduce a new annotated dataset of pets covering 37 different breeds of cats and dogs. The visual problem is very challenging as these animals, particularly cats, are very deformable and there can be quite subtle differences between the breeds. We make a number of contributions: first, we introduce a model to classify a pet breed automatically from an image. The model combines shape, captured by a deformable part model detecting the pet face, and appearance, captured by a bag-of-words model that describes the pet fur. Fitting the model involves automatically segmenting the animal in the image. Second, we compare two classification approaches: a hierarchical one, in which a pet is first assigned to the cat or dog family and then to a breed, and a flat one, in which the breed is obtained directly. We also investigate a number of animal and image orientated spatial layouts. These models are very good: they beat all previously published results on the challenging ASIRRA test (cat vs dog discrimination). When applied to the task of discriminating the 37 different breeds of pets, the models obtain an average accuracy of about 59%, a very encouraging result considering the difficulty of the problem.")

anaylzeBlock("Four score and seven years ago our fathers brought forth on this continent, a new nation, conceived in Liberty, and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal. Now we are engaged in a great civil war, testing whether that nation, or any nation so conceived and so dedicated, can long endure. We are met on a great battle-field of that war. We have come to dedicate a portion of that field, as a final resting place for those who here gave their lives that that nation might live. It is altogether fitting and proper that we should do this. But, in a larger sense, we can not dedicate -- we can not consecrate -- we can not hallow -- this ground. The brave men, living and dead, who struggled here, have consecrated it, far above our poor power to add or detract. The world will little note, nor long remember what we say here, but it can never forget what they did here. It is for us the living, rather, to be dedicated here to the unfinished work which they who fought here have thus far so nobly advanced. It is rather for us to be here dedicated to the great task remaining before us -- that from these honored dead we take increased devotion to that cause for which they gave the last full measure of devotion -- that we here highly resolve that these dead shall not have died in vain -- that this nation, under God, shall have a new birth of freedom -- and that government of the people, by the people, for the people, shall not perish from the earth.")
